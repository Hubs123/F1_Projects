# F1 Projects 🏎️📊

F1 Projects is a collection of data-driven projects inspired by Formula 1.
The goal of this repository is to explore the world of motorsport through data analysis, prediction, and optimization techniques.

Currently, the repository includes two main projects:

## 🔮 Pole Predictor

A tool designed to predict pole position lap times based on:
	•	Historical race data
	•	Practice session lap times

Built as a learning project in data preprocessing, modeling, and predictive analytics.

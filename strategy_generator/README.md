# Strategy Generator 🏁

Strategy Generator is a project that aims to calculate the most optimal race strategy in Formula 1.
It analyzes circuit-specific data and tire performance information provided by Pirelli to recommend the best pit stop and tire usage strategy for a given race.

## 📖 About the Project

This project was created from a passion for Formula 1 and as an opportunity to deepen skills in data analysis, optimization, and simulation.
The focus is on understanding how different factors influence race outcomes and how teams can maximize performance through strategy.

## 🔧 Features
	•	Uses track-specific data and Pirelli tire information
	•	Generates an optimal pit stop strategy for a race
	•	Designed as a learning project in data-driven decision-making

## 🛠 Planned Features

Future iterations will also consider:
	•	🌧 Rain and changing weather conditions
	•	🚨 Safety car deployments
	•	⛽ Fuel weight reduction as the race progresses
